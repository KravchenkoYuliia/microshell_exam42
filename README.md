Exam Rank 04



🦄 Allowed functions: malloc, free, write, close, fork, waitpid, signal, kill, exit, chdir, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, strcmp, strncmp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will behave like executing a shell command
🍩 The command line to execute will be the arguments of this program
🍿 Executable's path will be absolute or relative but your program must not build a path (from the PATH variable for example)
🐙 You must implement "|" and ";" like in bash
	- we will never try a "|" immediately followed or preceded by nothing or "|" or ";"
🐝 Your program must implement the built-in command cd only with a path as argument (no '-' or without parameters)
	- if cd has the wrong number of argument your program should print in STDERR "error: cd: bad arguments" followed by a '\n'
	- if cd failed your program should print in STDERR "error: cd: cannot change directory to path_to_change" followed by a '\n' with path_to_change replaced by the argument to cd
	- a cd command will never be immediately followed or preceded by a "|"
🌈 You don't need to manage any type of wildcards (*, ~ etc...)
🍇 You don't need to manage environment variables ($BLA ...)
🐰 If a system call, except execve and chdir, returns an error your program should immediatly print "error: fatal" in STDERR followed by a '\n' and the program should exit
🥺 If execve failed you should print "error: cannot execute executable_that_failed" in STDERR followed by a '\n' with executable_that_failed replaced with the path of the failed executable (It should be the first argument of execve)
🍕 Your program should be able to manage more than hundreds of "|" even if we limit the number of "open files" to less than 30.

for example this should work 🦋
🦋./microshell /bin/ls "|" /usr/bin/grep microshell ";" /bin/echo i love my microshell
output:
microshell
i love my microshell

🦋./microshell /bin/ls ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" ";" /bin/ls
output:
microshell fichier.c
microshell fichier.c


Hints 💡
Don't forget to pass the environment variable to execve

Hints 💡
Do not leak file descriptors!
